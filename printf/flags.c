/*The inner loop searches through the FLAGS_CH array for a character*/
/*that matches the current character in the format string. If a match*/
/*is found, the corresponding bit value from FLAGS_ARR is added to the*/
/*flags variable using the bitwise OR operator (|).*/

/*If no match is found in FLAGS_CH, the inner loop is terminated and the*/
/*outer loop continues to the next character in the format string.*/

/*Finally, the value of b is assigned to *i (which is a pointer to an*/
/*integer) and then decremented by 1 before being returned as the function's output*/
